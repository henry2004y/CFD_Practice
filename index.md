# CFD Practice In Julia

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->


## The base with Markdown

* element with **bold**
* element with _emph_


## Pages and structure

Here are a few empty pages connecting to the menu links to show where files can go and the resulting paths. (It's probably best if you look at the source folder for this).

* [Introduction and Review](/chap1/)
* [Mesh Generation](/chap2/)


## Header and Footer

As you can see here at the bottom of the page, there is a footer which you may want on all pages but for instance you may want the date of last modification to be displayed.

```html
Last modified: {{ fill fd_mtime }}.
```
